Movie Prediction
Overview
This project predicts the success of movies using machine learning techniques. It leverages various features such as genre, budget, cast, director, and other relevant attributes to predict box office revenue or user ratings.

Features
Data Collection: Scrapes and processes data from movie databases (e.g., IMDb, TMDb).
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data, handling missing values and categorical encoding.
Feature Engineering: Generates new features from existing data to enhance model performance.
Model Training: Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for prediction.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
Prediction: Provides predictions on new, unseen data.
