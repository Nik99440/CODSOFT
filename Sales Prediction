Sales Prediction
Overview
This project predicts future sales for a business using machine learning models. It uses historical sales data and various features like store type, promotional information, seasonality, and macroeconomic factors to predict sales for upcoming periods.

Features
Data Collection: Gathers historical sales data from different sources (e.g., CSV files, databases).
Data Preprocessing: Cleans data, handles missing values, and encodes categorical features.
Feature Engineering: Extracts features like holidays, promotions, and weather impact to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Training: Implements machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to predict sales.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Forecasting: Predicts sales for upcoming periods using trained models.
